BoneJ Headless Scripts for Python 
===========

***BoneJ Headless Python Wrapper Scripts for Bone Morphological Analysis***

Microstructure metrics are calculated to characterize bone morphology and skeletal geometry. BoneJ is a Fiji plugin for calculating microstrucutre metrics with unique plugins not available from commercial scanners. The plugins can be automated with simple Fiji macros, but this still requires some GUI dependence that prevents complete automation of all functionalities. This repository allows for automation of BoneJ without GUI dependence and can allow for quick processing of large datasets, access to Python libraries, and scripts to optimize input parameters for specific metrics. The plugins were used to compute micorstructure metrics for several microCT images of lumbar vertebrae. All scripts are written in Python and can only be executed on Linux OS. For testing purposes an image of a trabecular bone from a shrew was included.

BoneJ Headless Plugins
-------------------
The code included in this repository will allow you to compute these common microstructure metrics:

1. Thickness
2. Separation
3. Anisotropy
4. Ellipsoid Factor
5. Bone Volume Fraction 
6. Connectivity

Secondary metrics not as commonly used in literature are also included here: 
1. Intertrabecular Angles 
2. Skeletonize 
3. Analyze Skeleton 
4. Fractal Dimension
5. Surface Area

Functions can be used for batch processing or processing only one input image. BoneJ Headless takes binary numpy arrays as inputs. 
The Examples folder shows how to import specific metrics to use for processing. The scripts labelled BoneJ_Scripts and Secondary_Scripts include batch scripts for large processing
  
Installation
------------

Before proceeding, make sure you have all the requirements listed above.

Fiji can be installed from the [official website](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads). 
BoneJ must be added as a plugin within the Fiji installation. Instructions can be found from the [official website](https://imagej.net/plugins/bonej#installation).

Clone the repository 

`git clone https://github.com/BoneJ_Headless`

Install the required python libraries. 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage
-----

First try BoneJ_Module.py to load and run metrics on a single image. You can import any of the available metrics and adjust input paremeters.:

`BoneJ_Module_Example.py`

> You might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

Each example requires an input and output directory to set by the user, along with the voxel size of the image, and the Fiji directory path. 

> All ``example ROIs`` are accompanied by an ``.nrrd``. The ``.nrrd`` file can be opened in the Fiji software as well.

About the Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools
----------
The enclosed tool is part of the [Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools](https://cdrh-rst.fda.gov/)
, which provides a peer-reviewed resource for stakeholders to use where standards and qualified Medical Device Development Tools (MDDTs) do not yet exist. These tools do not replace FDA-recognized standards or MDDTs. This catalog collates a variety of regulatory science tools that the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL) developed. These tools use the most innovative science to support medical device development and patient access to safe and effective medical devices. If you are considering using a tool from this catalog in your marketing submissions, note that these tools have not been qualified as [Medical Device Development Tools](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-development-tools-mddt) and the FDA has not evaluated the suitability of these tools within any specific context of use.
